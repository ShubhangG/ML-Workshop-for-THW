# ML-Workshop-for-THW
Doing some fun machine learning with "The Hacker Within" community, on 3rd October 


As Scientists you may be familiar with Machine Learning before. If you have played with some sort of function fitting then you have seen some aspect of Machine Learning(ML).

It is the current HOT topic, and it looks good on your resume. People think its alchemy and some people have very strong opinions about it.
But I am going to show you how you can use it in your daily life (or scientific career).

**MACHINE LEARNING, WHAT IS?**

Machine learning is a glorified way of finding a function iteratively. Basically, Newton's method, on steroids.
These functions need not be something analytic nor should look like any standard function you think of when you hear the word function.

ML is useful for forecasting, finding patterns, function fitting, classifying and plenty more.

Today, we will try and solve a problem, which you may have experienced as a scientist.


_DUPLICATE ENTRIES_ 

By Duplicate, I don't mean EXACT match, it could be a bit off. You could have two things mapping to the same entry while your computer thinks they are completely different. 

Simulation data for 1000K Hyd
Sim data for 1000K Hydrogen
Simulation dat for 1kK H

THEY ALL MATCH TO THE SAME SIMULATION DATA!

But more than cleaning up records I want you to take away from this workshop the tools and approaches that are taken when solving a problem using machine learning.

STEP 1:
Collecting the data

We will be working with toy data I made.
I have provided a link with all names
